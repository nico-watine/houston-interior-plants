<h3 style="text-transform: none; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0; color: #569300;">How do I select the right plants based on their light requirements?</h3>
<p>Light is the most important factor to consider when selecting and buying interior plants. With so many indoor plants available, how do you choose the right one? Let's first look at the process that makes you want to buy home or office plants.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">You want to decorate your home or office with interior plants, or maybe you just have a spot where you want a plant.</strong></p>
<p>Because light is so important, you need to look at each room and each place you want a plant and evaluate the level of light.
Interior plants are categorized in 3 different ways: <em>High Light, Medium Light</em> and <em>Low Light</em>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">High Light Plants</span></strong><br>
High Light is for a plant located next to a bright window or sun filled room. Direct sun is never recommended for indoor plants. Filtered light or indirect light is best. <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Medium Light Plants</span></strong><br>
Medium Light is what a plant gets when being away from a window and possibly receives supplemental artificial light for at least 8 hours a day. How far and how strong the natural source of light will determine the need for additional artificial light. A plant by a window facing North is probably receiving Medium Light. A plant in a room at the opposite side of windows is also probably receiving Medium Light. <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Low Light Plants</span></strong><br>
Low Light is a space without natural light but with artificial light on for 12 hours a day. It's a room in a house with small windows partially covered with blinds or drapes. It's a conference room without windows or a hallway with bright lights on.
Once you have a good feel for your light levels, start making choices through the appropriate categories. <br>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">You found a plant you love but aren't sure if it's the right plant for your space.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help you succeed at keeping your interior plant healthy and growing! It is important that before you purchase a plant, you are sure that its "perfect place" actually has the right environment for it to thrive. <br> <br>
Never forget that the most important factor in a house plant's growth success is the amount of light it receives. For example, if your chosen spot only gets artificial light, you want to make sure not to buy a "high light plant," such as a <a href="/shop-for-plants/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/" target="_blank">Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree</a>.</p>
