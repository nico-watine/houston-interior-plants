<h3>Specimen Details</h3>

<h3>Designer Advice</h3>
<p>Aesthetically versatile, the Ficus Alii can be used anywhere and in all decor styles, so long as it receives its necessary high light. The decorative container in which it is placed will set set its style and tone. For a back porch or sunroom, consider placing it in a rattan basket. If you are looking to fill a contemporary space, place it in a tall slender container. It also looks great in a China bowl if a wood paneled corner office is the space in question.</p>
