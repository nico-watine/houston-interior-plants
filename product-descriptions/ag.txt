Very easy to maintain

Aglaonemas are very decorative plants and come in many leaf variegations. The "Emerald Beauty" is known for its darker foliage with a touch of lighter green. The foliage stays compact and full. They look great when kept with a low shine.

Designer advice: Perfect to be used on each side of a console table or buffet. Also great in an office next to a desk to hide all those unsightly wires.
Light: Agloanemas can withstand a lower level of light, such as being far away from a window or in a room with artificial lights only.
 Water: Keep on the dry side. 
 Average size: 20/24" wide 26/28" high (without decorative container)
