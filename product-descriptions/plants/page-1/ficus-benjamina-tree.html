<h3>Specimen Details</h3>
<p>The Ficus Benjamina is one of the most used indoor trees ever. They were super popular in office settings in the 80's and 90's, and remain an office staple. The arrival and availability of other tree and ficus varieties have slightly lessened their popularity, however.</p>

<h3>Designer Advice</h3>
<p>Aesthetically versatile, the Ficus Benjamina can be used anywhere and in all decor styles, so long as it receives its necessary high light. The decorative container in which it is placed will set set its style and tone. For a back porch or sunroom, consider placing it in a rattan basket. If you are looking to fill a contemporary space, place it in a tall slender container. It also looks great in a China bowl if a wood paneled corner office is the space in question.</p>
