<h3>Specimen Details</h3>
<p>A member of the <em>Dracaena</em> family, our Warneckii canes are grown in Hawaii and are of unsurpassed quality. This is a rather under used plant which deserves more considerations when decorating with plants. We particularly love the white lines on the leaves, as they add a very beautiful contrast of colors.</p>

<h3>Designer Advice</h3>
<p>With its tall and thin look, it is the perfect choice for the corner of a room. We like to use the Warneckii canes in offices â€“ usually in the opposite corner of the windows. These are also a solid choice when you need to add height to a room.</p>

<h3>Why We Love Them</h3>
<p>- Air cleaning top performer <br>
- Tall &amp; thin, great corner plant</p>
