<h3>Designer Advice</h3>
<p>The Hawaiian Lisa Cane is a very versatile plant. With its low light requirement and it's tall thin shape, it can be placed in any corner away from a window. These are a great alternative to the common <a href="/shop-for-plants/corn-plant/">Corn Plant</a>. They are very low maintenance and have slicker, more updated look. While it does fit into Medium containers with its 10" pot, a Large container is recommended due to its height.</p>
